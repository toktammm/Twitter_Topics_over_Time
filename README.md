# Probabilistic Topic Modeling over Time for Online Social Media Trends

Implementation of the probabilistic topic modeling with categorical time distribution for Twitter, proposed in:

Oghaz, T. A., Mutlu, E. C., Jasser, J., Yousefi, N., & Garibay, I. (2020). Probabilistic Model of Narratives Over Topical Trends in Social Media: A Discrete Time Model. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.06793.

## Requirements

Most of the training code is used form [here.](https://github.com/ahmaurya/topics_over_time) and is tested on:
- Python 3.6

### Dataset
This dataset was provided to us by [Leidos Inc](https://www.leidos.com/) as part of the Computational Simulation of Online Social Behavior ([SocialSim])(https://www.darpa.mil/program/computational-simulation-of-online-social-behavior) program initiated by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). But, similar dataset can be downloaded from the tweeter API with keyword and/or hashtag query for a specific domain. Our dataset contains tweets on the domain of White Helmets of Syria over a period of 13 month from April 2018 to April 2019. We analyzed more than 1,052,000 tweets.
